    <h2> Weight </h2>
    <p>Every piece of equipment you have on makes your character heavier. Under 25% of your max weight will have your character considered light. You will be able to run and roll quickly. Above 25% and under 50% your character is mid weight. Your walk, run and roll will all be slowed down. Above 50% you are classified as a heavy character. You will walk run and roll extremely slowly. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h1> Weapons</h1>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Fist</h2>
      <p>Fist type weapons are few in number and in uses. They are only aquired by buying them from specific merchants or by joining a covenant late in the game. </p>
  </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Hammers</h2>
      <p>Hammers are strong short range meele weapons that can be easily weilded with one hand. Two handing them however will increase their damage. They are an attractive option for Strength based characters as their damage scales with strength. They are very straight foward weapons that can also use a shield easily. Most hammers upon missing an attack will cause the character to stagger.</p>
      <h2>Great Hammers</h2>
      <p>Like the Smaller hammers the Great hammers are very attractive choices for strength characters. The great hammers require high strength to be able to one hand them. Even when your character has the strength to one hand them, the attacks come out slow and require much forethought so you do not take unnecessary damage. Most hammers upon missing an attack will cause the character to stagger.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Axes</h2>
      <p>Axes are slow but deal great damage. Axes have more than one stat requirement to wield them, therefore their damage scales with both Strength and dexterity.  Because of the low stats needed to wield it one handed, it is easy to keep a shield in your off hand.</p>
      <h2>Great Axes</h2>
      <p>Similar to its smaller counterpart the Great Axes require a combination of strength and dexterity to wield them properly. Because of its large requirement, off handing a shield can be very difficult. Its immense weight requires the full force of ones body, meaning any miss will leave you quite vulnerable. Any foe hit with its weight will be pushed back, a true testament to its wielders strength.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Daggers</h2>
      <p>Daggers are small weapons typically wielded with one hand, leaving the other hand open for a small shield or a second knife, either used for parrying. The daggers all have a very minimal strength requirement and a moderate dexterity requirement. The Daggers are used mainly for critical type hits, such as riposteing and back stabs as their normal damage is poor. However the fact that the basic attacks are very quick means that they can more than suffice if you find yourself in a tight situation.</p>
    </section>
<section>
      <h2>Thrusting weapons</h2>
      <p>Regular one-handed attack can be delivered with shield held up. Can parry with use of left hand. Thrusting attacks pierce and are effective against foes with hard exteriors, but the wielder is left open to damage after a swing. Thrusting weapons offer great bonuses to damage based off of dexterity. </p>
</section>
<section>
      <h2>Straight Swords</h2>
      <p>Straight swords require close to if not eaxtly an equal amount of strength and dexterity. For certain starting classes these will require some effort to be able to be wielded sufficiently. The straight swords off a good balance of damage, range and speed, they also can be one handed somewhat easily offering the chance to use a shield with no real penalty. </p>
      <h2>Great swords</h2>
      <p>Greatswords are normally wielded with two hands due to their great weight. Usually swung in large arcs and effective against multiple foes. Far from ideal when fighting in tight quarters. They have a moderately high strength requirement and a slightly lower dexterity requirement. Those that are able to learn the ins and outs of the great sword are rewarded with great damage and moderate bonus damage from both strength and dexterity.</p>
<h2> Ultra Great Swords</h2>
<p>The wielder of ultra great swords must still be inhumanly strong. Its great weight sends foes flying when hit solidly. Because of its great weight all the swings from these swords are painfully slow, made even slower if you choose, if you are even able, to one hand the beast. The risk vs. reward is large when using the Ultra great swords.</p>
    </section>
<section>
      <h2>Katanas</h2>
      <p>Katanas are few in the world of Dark souls. They do poor damage but make up for it with their light weight and quick strikes. Those that wish to find and use Katanas will find themselves focusing on dexterity and light armor.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Curved Swords</h2>
      <p>Curved swords require high dexterity to wield. They have a short range but relatively quick slashes that let them hit multiple times safely. Because they are a dexterity weapon it is best to pair them with a bow and a parrying shield/dagger. Mainly because their damage can leave something to be desired.</p>
      <h2>Curved Greatswords</h2>
      <p>Curved Greatswords in a similar fashion to their smaller counterpart require a high amount of dexterity to be wielded. While slower than regualr curved swords they can offer much more damage while still having dexterity scaling on them. Meaning if you are looking to pack a little more punch but don't want to give up on your dexterity, this is your paradise. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Spears</h2>
      <p>Spears are effective against hard exteriors, and can hit
for high damage at the right moment of an
enemy's swing. But the hit radius is small,
and it is easily blocked by shields.</p>
      <h2>Halberds</h2>
      <p>With all Halberds, if  your attack doesn't connect with an enemy, your character will stumble  and seem to not be able to handle the weight. Halberds are found at all points throughout Dark souls, meaning there are many chances to find them. Halberds require a combination of strength and dexterity to wield properly. Neither stats reqire high numbers meaning they can easily be wielded early and one handed with ease.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Bows</h2>
      <p>The first bow can be purchased from the very first merchant and remains quite useful throughout the game. while the damage can leave you wanting is usefulness in pulling enemies makes it one of the most useful weapons in the game. It can be manually aimed to take on foes at a greater distance. The downside to the bow is that you must wield it with two hands, meaning you are unable to defend from attacks if enemies get to close.</p>
      <h2>Crossbows</h2>
      <p>Crossbows can do far more damage than the basic type bows, the downside being that you can not manually aim them. The crossbow comes with one more advantage and that is that it only requires one hand to wield meaning you are able to have your shield readied in your off hand in case of an emergency.</p>
      <h2>Greatbows</h2>
      <p>There are only two greatbows in the entirety of Dark Souls. One mid way through the main game and one mid way through the DLC. Greatbows are larger than your character and offer great damage. They can be manually aimed like regular bows. The downside of Greatbows is their speed, they must be hooked into the ground to be fired and it doesn't stay hooked when an arrow is loosed, meaning it must be rehooked everytime you want to fire an arrow. The other downside of greatbows is that the arrows you need to fire them can only be purchased from two merchants, one next to each of the bows, and the arrows cost quite a bit.</p>
    </section>
<section>
      <h2>Whips      </h2>
      <p>Whips are merely a niche weapon as they do poor damage and only if the enemy has exposed flesh. If your character is heavily based on Dexterity then the whip may be a fun choice but ultimately will be traded out for better weapons. There are only three whips in dark souls, one hidden on a dead body early in the game, one midway through that comes from killing an invading Npc and the final one comes from cutting the tail off the forst boss monster of the DLC.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h1> Shields</h1>
</section>
<section>
      <h2>Small      </h2>
      <p>Small shields are light of weight and not very stable. They are mainly used for their secondary effecy, Parrying. Small shields are all able to parry the enemies attacks letting the Player riposte for high damage. Small shields are most useful on light weight characters that like to use smaller weapons. </p>
</section>
<section>
      <h2>Normal</h2>
      <p>Like small shields, the normal sized shields are able to parry. THey are also muck more stable, making them a good choice for a balanced character. However, because of their larger size it can be difficult to keep your characters light weight, but not to difficult to keep them mid weight.</p>
</section>

<section>
      <h2>Large</h2>
      <p>The large shields are unable to parry. Instead the parry is replaced with a shield bash. The large shields are very stable and very heavy. THey also require a large amount of strenght to wield properly. Because shields are in your off hand, is is HIGHLY reccommended that you meet the full requirement to wield them. Unless you have your character in extremely light clothing, it is unlikely that you wil be under 50% weight if you are using a large shield.</p>
