      <h2>Gifts</h2>
      <p>When creating your character you have the option of selecting from one of eight starting gifts.</p>
      <p><strong>Binoculars</strong> - Use to peer at faraway sights. Not recommended because it can be found in the graveyard of the Firelink Shrine, the starting area.</p>
      <p><strong>Black Firebombs</strong> - Explodes upon impact when thrown. More deadly than a standard firebomb. If chosen, you start with 10 black firebombs. This gift is usually chosen for the purpose of obtaining the Demon's Great Hammer at the start of the game.</p>
      <p><strong>Divine blessing</strong> - Divine holy water. Fully restores HP and removes negative status effects. Can be found in various places and sold by several merchants in the game.</p>
      <p><strong>Master Key </strong>- Opens any basic lock. Initial equipment for a Thief. Opens a few shortcuts to access powerful items early in the game, may also let you skip certain areas. Not recommended for beginners that want to experience intended play. The key can be obtained from Domhnall of Zena after he relocates to under the bridge at Firelink Shrine.</p>
      <p><strong>Old Witch's Ring</strong> - Gift from a witch. Enables you to talk to Quelaag's Sister. This is just story dialogue and has nothing to do with accessing the Chaos Servant covenant. This ring can also be obtained by trading Sunlight Maggot with Snuggly the Crow.</p>
      <p><strong>Pendant</strong> - Trinket. No effect, but fond memories comfort travelers. Used to trade with Snuggly the Crow for Souvenir of Reprisal (covenenat related item). Can be obtained by following Rhea of Thorolund's storyline and has a rare chance of being given after killing a human after being summoned by Alvina (with the Cat Covenant Ring) as a member of the Forest Hunter covenant.</p>
      <p><strong>Tiny Being's Ring</strong> - Special tribal ring. Grants 5% maximum HP boost. <em>The Gift menu during character creation erroneously claims that it recovers HP.</em> Not recommended because you can gain Vitality easily at the start of Firelink Shrine area. Given as a reward from Siegmeyer of Catarina in Anor Londo.</p>
      <p><strong>Twin Humanities</strong> - Tiny sprite called humanity. Sometimes found on carcasses. Can be found in the Undead Burg and used by the player (to become human and kindle bonfires) or traded with Snuggly the Crow.</p>

      <h2> Picking your class</h2>
      <p>The starting class does little more than give you a jump start towards the hero you want to be. Every class can be upgraded to use any and every weapon and spell.</p>
      </section>
      <h2>Warrior</h2>
      <p><img src="images/dark souls classes/Warrior.jpg" width="217" height="373" class="fltlft">The Warrior is a good all-round choice due to the character's combination of high strength and dexterity, allowing them to make use of most early equipment they come across. It also has respectable intelligence and faith stats, so using magic is an option if you want to put a few levels into one of these stats but otherwise you can work on them later on when you have access to greater spells. The heater shield is a very good starting addition, as it will allow the Warrior to block 100% of physical damage from the beginning of the game. Their strong starting armor combined with decent resistance can make them a good choice for players that like to be defensive and patient. Their armor is also not as encumbering compared to that of Knight, allowing them enough mobility to roll effectively.</p>
      <p>The Warriors starting equipment - Longsword, Heater Shield, Standard Helm, Hard Leather Armor, Hard Leather Gauntlets &amp; Hard Leather Boots    </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Knight</h2>
      <p><img src="images/dark souls classes/Knight.jpg" width="223" height="408" class="fltlft">The Knight is a tank class, starting with the highest vitality value of all classes, as well as the most robust equipment. This does mean that Knights move slowly, so you will need to fight carefully and expect to take some hits. Most weapons are easily equippable by a Knight, and their faith stat is high enough to use miracles for healing, but you&rsquo;ll need to increase your strength in order to focus on killing enemies in as few attacks as possible.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The knights starting equipment - Broadsword, Tower Kite Shield, Knight Helm, Knight Armor, Knight Gauntlets, &amp; Knight Leggings    </p>

      <h2>Wanderer</h2>
      <p><img src="images/dark souls classes/Wanderer.jpg" width="222" height="353" class="fltlft">Wanderers are another good all-round class, but with a focus on speed and evading, rather than high defense. Their vitality is relatively low, so getting hit is a bad idea. The scimitar is a very useful starting weapon due to the classes high dexterity, its high attack speed and the large radius of its attacks. You&rsquo;ll want to close the distance quickly and use fast combos to take out enemies before they can attack. You&rsquo;ll also have the option to fight at range with a bow, or with spells thanks to their fairly high attunement and intelligence stats.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Wanderer Starting equipment - Scimitar, Leather Shield, Wanderer Hood,Wanderer Coat,Wanderer Manchette, &amp; Wanderer Boots</p>

      <h2>Theif</h2>
      <p><img src="images/dark souls classes/Thief.jpg" width="187" height="371" class="fltlft">The high critical rate the Thief enjoys is a very nice advantage, especially when combined with the speed of their dagger attacks. They aren&rsquo;t built very solidly, however, with low vitality, strength and endurance stats making them a weak target and also reducing their weapon choices. The dagger is capable of dealing with most enemies perfectly well, and compliments the Thief&rsquo;s speed and evasive style. They also come with the master key by default, which allows them to select a different gift and access many locked doors much easier than other classes could.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The theif starting equipment - Bandit's Knife, Target Shield, Thief Mask, Black Leather Armor, Black Leather Gloves ,Black Leather Boots, &amp; a Master Key</p>

      <h2>Bandit</h2>
      <p><img src="images/dark souls classes/Bandit.jpg" width="243" height="369" class="fltlft">The Bandit specializes in hard-hitting physical attacks, and is great with weapons such as axes and straight swords. The starting battle axe is great for the game&rsquo;s early areas, where dealing with enemies in as few hits as possible is important. Their high endurance and strength will mean that of all classes they deal the most damage at the beginning of the game. The Spider Shield blocks 100% of physical damage, and has excellent poison resistance.<br>
      The Bandit&rsquo;s magic stats are very poor, so using any kind of magic isn&rsquo;t an option without spending a lot of levels on one of those stats. Their starting armor also isn&rsquo;t great, but you will have no trouble equipping better armor and shields as you find them.</p>
      <p>THe Bandit starting equipment - Battle Axe, Spider Shield, Brigand Hood, Brigand Armor, Brigand Gauntlets, &amp; Brigand Trousers</p>

      <h2>Hunter</h2>
      <p><img src="images/dark souls classes/Hunter.jpg" width="211" height="367" class="fltlft">Hunters can be used to specialize in bows, due to their high initial dexterity stat. They&rsquo;ll also favor high dexterity weapons such as Spears and Rapiers. Low equip load means they can roll fast and evade well; using quicker weapons to strike and retreat.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The Hunter starting equipment - Shortsword,
        
        Short Bow,
        
        Standard Arrow x30,
        
        Large Leather Shield,
        
        Leather Armor,
        
        Leather Gloves, &amp;
        
        Leather Boots    </p>

      <h2>Sorcerer</h2>
      <p><img src="images/dark souls classes/Sorceror.jpg" width="201" height="357" class="fltlft">If you want to use magic as your primary offensive tool, then the sorcerer is the best class to begin with. The Soul Arrow will be your primary source of damage early in the game, and with 30 uses it can weaken enemies easily. Due to the sorcerer's high attunement both sorcery and pyromancy are viable early on. Using physical weapons will be a struggle, though, so you&rsquo;ll be limited to your dagger unless you spend points on strength. The sorcerer's dexterity is decent, so using spears is also an option. This can provide you with a fallback at times when enemies are resistant to your magic. The sorcerer is definitely a tough class to use during the early and mid-game, but pays off once you obtain access to higher-end spells and catalysts.</p>
      <p>The Sorcerer starting equipment - Dagger,
        
        Small Leather Shield,
        
        Sorcerer's Catalyst,
        
        Sorcerer Hat,
        
        Sorcerer Cloak,
        
        Sorcerer Gauntlets,
        
        Sorcerer Boots, and the spell 
        
        Soul Arrow</p>

      <h2>Pyromancer</h2>
      <p><img src="images/dark souls classes/Pyromancer.jpg" width="202" height="383" class="fltlft">Powerful rechargeable Fire "grenade" and decent melee make the Pyromancer a good choice for offensive players. The Hand Axe is suitable for killing minor enemies, allowing the Fireball to be saved for more threatening ones and bosses. Several early bosses are vulnerable to Fire too: The Asylum Demon, Taurus Demon and the first of the two Belfry Gargoyles, making the Fireball extra useful.</p>
      <p>Pyromancy spells do not scale with any stat. The only way to increase their damage is to upgrade the Pyromancy Flame using various vendors found throughout the game. Since the "first" vendor capable of upgrading the Pyromancy Flame, Laurentius, does not appear until he is rescued from the Depths, melee upgrades should take priority early on. However, due to Fireball's high initial damage, it remains useful against bosses and powerful enemies well into the game.</p>
      <p>The Tattered Set has low defense, but provides excellent early-game resistance against fire and poison, and the Hand Axe can be an excellent weapon for certain playstyles due to fast attacks and good stamina damage. The weak link in this class's starting equipment is the worthless Cracked Round Shield, but decent shields are easy to come by early in the game.</p>
      <p>The Pyromancer starting equipment - Hand Axe,

Cracked Round Shield,

Pyromancy Flame,

Tattered Cloth Hood,

Tattered Cloth Robe,

Tattered Cloth Manchette,

Heavy Boots, and the spell

Fireball&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Cleric</h2>
      <p><img src="images/dark souls classes/Cleric.jpg" width="213" height="365" class="fltlft">From the beginning of the game clerics can use miracles to heal thanks to their high starting faith stat and equipped talisman. Their other stats are fairly average, so you&rsquo;ll have plenty of freedom in weapon selection after a few level ups. The low dexterity does hamper this a little, but you can use weapons such as maces and hammers to get around this or simply level up on dexterity a bit.</p>
      <p>The cleric can be a good character for players who find themselves running out of flasks to heal up between battles when venturing through the game. As far as the mid to late game is concerned, joining the covenant Warrior of Sunlight is especially beneficial to clerics as they will get access to those rare offensive miracles such as Lightning Spear and Great Lightning Spear.</p>
      <p>The Cleric starting equipment - Mace,

East-West Shield,

Canvas Talisman,

Holy Robe,

Traveling Gloves,

Holy Trousers and the miracle 

Heal&nbsp;</p>

      <h2>Deprived</h2>
      <p><img src="images/dark souls classes/Deprived.jpg" width="199" height="370" class="fltlft">The Deprived is a class that lacks any kind of initial specialization, has very minimal starting gear, and lacks any sorcery, pyromancy, or miracles. This class can be viewed as a first time players hardest starting class because all your gear through the game will be obtained or purchased and you have little advantage over a class with stat specialization. While the balanced stats may look inviting at first, ultimately, they are a hindering factor due to the nature of some stats being fairly undesired with many builds. This class will start out favoring a melee style of play so people more comfortable playing as a mage or archer may want to avoid this as their first class. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Deprived starting eqipment - Club, Plank Shield</p>
