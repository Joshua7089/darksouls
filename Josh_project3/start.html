      <h2>Open the door</h2>
      <p>You awaken in a prison cell. Grab the key and head out.Your first step is to take the Dungeon Cell Key from the corpse near  your feet. With that in hand, move to the door and process outside. You'll emerge into a long corridor. Make your way up it and read  the messages on the floor to gain a better understanding of the game's  controls.There are two Hollows in this area. They are an incredibly weak  enemy and will die very easily, so practice your attack skills on them  if you wish. If you look to your right you will also see a huge demon stomping  around in a room, although there's little you can do right now to stop  it. Make your way into the next room and you'll find all about target  locking. Use this to kill the Hollow sitting in the shallow pool. Keep moving and ascend the ladder at the end of the corridor.  You'll emerge into a courtyard, and a message on the floor will instruct  you about the purpose of a Bonfire, a tool that restores your HP when  you rest at it. </p>

      <h2>Ready to run</h2>
      <p>Once you're all rested up, proceed up the stairs and open the heavy double doors. Proceed cautiously into the next area, as your first major  challenge is about to appear. <img src="images/Npc/asylum-demon.jpg" width="300" height="356" class="fltlft">Known as the Asylum Demon, this dangerous  enemy is almost impossible to beat right now without good equipment and  no healing items. In fact, it's not recommended that you fight this enemy at all.  Instead you should sprint past it, into a doorway on the left. This will  shut behind you, leaving the boss behind for the momemt. you'll find yourself in another corridor afterwards. Head down it, light the next bonfire and proceed into the next area. Be quick and grab your Shield from the corpse to your left.  Immediately afterwards duck into the nearby alcove and equip your shield  to your left arm. You'll need to do this to avoid the Hollow shooting  arrows at you from further up the corridor. With your shield equipped, hold block and continue moving up the  corridor, deflecting the Hollow's arrows harmlessly. Send him from this  world with your weapon once you're close enough. The Hollow guards a weapon on the floor that is better than your  currently equipped item, so be sure to swap it out for the new one. Once you're suitably armed and the Hollow is dead, walk up the stairs and through the wall of mist. </p>

      <h2>Your first friend</h2>
      <p>You'll find yourself in a large, three storey courtyard. Immediately  in front of you you can see a knight behind a destroyed gate - he'll be  important in a moment. Continue forward and you'll find yourself at an intersection.  There's nothing of interest to the left, so head right. You'll now find  yourself at a stairwell. Heading downwards leads to a door that allows  you to return to the first bonfire, while the stairs upwards lead  towards a deadly boulder trap, so be ready to spring aside when it  drops.Â Turn around, and you'll find that the boulder smashed through a  wall at the bottom of the stairs. Inside the hole you'll find an errant  knight lying against a wall.<img src="images/Npc/oscar-knight-of-astora.jpg" width="300" height="449" class="fltlft"> Accept his quest, and he'll give you the  Undead Asylum F2 East Key as well as your first Estus Flasks. Turn around and head back up the stairs. Dispatch the Hollow guarding  the door and use the Undead Asylum F2 East Key to open the door. Once outside you'll emerge onto a balcony. Read the messages on  the floor to learn more about special attacks, then proceed with caution  around the corner where two sword Hollows and one Ranged Hollow await  you. Dispatch them one at a time by luring them out. Once they're dead, you can either go through a wall of mist, or  down to the right. There's nothing to the right except an Undead Knight,  but you can learn about parrying and ripostes by going this way. He  guards a locked door which you can't access yet, even with the Master  Key. </p>

      <h2>Ready to fight</h2>
      <p>The final challenge of the prologue resides behind the wispy gate of  white light. Before crossing the threshold, be sure to have your flask  selected and your melee weapon equipped. the Asylum Demon will be wandering around below you in the same courtyard you ran away from him in earlier. Don't linger on the platform, or the Asylum Demon will smash the ground from under your feet. Drop down onto its head and  attack as you're falling to deliver a sizable amount of damage before  the battle even begins. At this point, use whichever weapon suits your character. Eventually you'll take him down and receive the Big Pilgrim's Key. Use it on the heavy set of double doors and progress up the cliff to finish off the prologue.A short walk up the next hill will have you carried to Firelink shrine.</p>

      <h2>Firelink</h2>
      <p>From the moment you land, you will be face to face with the Crestfallen warrior. Talk to him a few times to get some information about the area and your role in the world. Once satisfied Head over and talk to Petrus. He has no intrest in talking to you but if you are persistant he will agree to teach you Miracles. It is highly recommended to purchase a talisman and the heal spell. This will give you an additionl five heals as you venture forth. Exploring Firelink will reward you with many lootable corpses that will give you a boost to your starting expierience. Once you have finished all you can find to do, you are ready. Head up the large hill past the well and from here chosen undead, you are on your own. Be safe, no one wants to see you go hollow.</p>
